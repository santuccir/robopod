# robopod
I have designed a Robopod which consists of two hub motors witch drive rubber tracks, I need to be able to control it via RC (RADIO CONTROL) The motors are the type which are used on the hover boards specs: are 36V,350Wat, 6.5 inch. diameter Hub motors with Hall sensores my problem is I can't find somthing off the shelf to control the motors simultaneously so that I can achieve a 0 tern effect so the Pod will pivot in one spot( Example to tern left, left wheel or (TRACK)rotates backwards and right wheel or (TRACK) rotates forward I have experience in Mechanical Engineering but my Electronics is limited any advise or help will be much appreciated
